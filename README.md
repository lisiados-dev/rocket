# Legally Distinct Missile

The **Legally Distinct Missile** (or LDM) is a fork of Rocket for Unturned maintained by the game developers (SDG) after the resignation of its original community team. Using this fork is recommended because it preserves compatibility, and has fixes for important legacy Rocket issues like multithreading exceptions and teleportation exploits.

## Installation

The dedicated server includes the latest version, so an external download is not necessary:
1. Copy the Rocket.Unturned module from the game's Extras directory.
2. Paste it into the game's Modules directory.

## Contributing

The goals of this repository are to maintain compatibility with Unturned, maintain backwards compatibility with plugins, and fix bugs. Changes outside that scope will be made to the Unturned API rather than reworking the Rocket API. New plugins should ideally be using the game API where possible.

Issues are monitored and will be discussed, but pull requests will not be directly merged.

## Resources

fr34kyn01535 has listed all of the original plugins in a post to the /r/RocketMod subreddit: [List of plugins from the old repository](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketmod/comments/ek4i7b/)

Following closure of the original forum the recommended sites for developer discussion are the [/r/UnturnedLDM](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnturnedLDM/) subreddit, [SDG Forum](https://forum.smartlydressedgames.com/c/modding/ldm), or the [Steam Discussions](https://steamcommunity.com/app/304930/discussions/17/).

## History

On the 20th of December 2019 Sven Mawby "fr34kyn01535" and Enes Sadık Özbek "Trojaner" officially ceased maintenance of Rocket. They kindly released the source code under the MIT license. [Read their full farewell statement here.](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket/blob/master/Farewell.md)

Following their resignation SDG forked the repository to continue maintenance in sync with the game.

On the 2nd of June 2020 fr34kyn01535 requested the fork be rebranded to help distance himself from the project.
